## Formatting

We use `prettier` to format our code. To format your code, simply run:

```
npm run prettier
```

To check the files that are already formatted, rather than overriding them:

```
npm run prettier-check
```

## Linting

We use `ESLint` to lint our code. To run the linter, simply run:

```
npm run eslint
```
